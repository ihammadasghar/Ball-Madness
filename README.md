A 3D game, collect coins &amp; dodge enemies. Engine: Unity, Scripts: C#.
I learnt the basics of game development in unity making this project.
## For trying out the windows build:
1. Clone or download repository
2. Navigate to builds/windows/ball-madness.exe
3. Avoid the enemies(cubes) & try collecting as many coins as you can, try not to fall off the platform.
